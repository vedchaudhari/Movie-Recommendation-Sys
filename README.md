# **Movie Recommendation Program**

This program is a movie recommendation system developed using various machine learning algorithms.

## **Getting Started**

To run the project, first, install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


** About The Program **
This is a simple demonstration of a machine learning program that uses techniques like Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 and algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find the nearest neighbors of a movie for recommendation to the user
based on prediction accuracy.
